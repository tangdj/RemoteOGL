Usage:

make lessonX

(where X is numeric)
to build tutorials 1-n individually.

Use:

make all

to build all tutorials at once.

Requirements:

Mesa (I used version 3.1beta)
Requires Mesa, Mesa's version of GLUT, and 
the headers and libraries.  I used the rpms from 
http://www.rpmfind.net (Mesa 3.1beta, Mesa GLUT3.1beta, 
Mesa-devel 3.1beta, Mesa GLUT-devel 3.1beta, but you can 
get mesa directly from http://www.mesa3d.org .

X (I used version 3.3.5)
I used the rpms from http://www.rpmfind.net, but 
you can get X directly from http://www.xfree86.org .

gcc (I used egcs 2.91.66)
I used the rpms from http://www.rpmfind.net, but 
you can get egcs/gcc directly from http://egcs.cygnus.com/ .

Known bugs:

Non motif window managers (including fvwm95 and whatever 
gnome uses) don't honor the window hints used to request
full screen.

TNT cards (or possibly mesa 3.0) don't like the alpha
buffer.  The fix is to change the line:

glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_ALPHA); 

to 
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGBA | GLUT_DOUBLE);
